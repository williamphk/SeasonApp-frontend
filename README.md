# SeasonApp-frontend
This repo is to demonstrate the use of client side rendering for ASP.NET Season application.

Key Files for this Project:

- index.html: This file serves as the main entry point for the application and contains the necessary HTML markup for the page. It includes an input field where users can input the temperature.
- script/script.js: This file uses an XMLHttpRequest to request data from the local server. Once the data, including the season name, temperature, and image URL, has been successfully retrieved, it is used to update the page dynamically. The page is updated after the request has been completed.
- styles/style.css: This file includes the CSS styles that are applied to the HTML elements on the page to enhance their appearance and layout.
